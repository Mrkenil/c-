## aim 1 : Write a "Garage" class that has a "Car" that is having troubles with its "Motor". Use a function-level try block in the "Garage" class constructor to catch an exception (thrown from the "Motor" class) when its "Car" object is initialized. Throw a different exception from the body of the "Garage" constructor s handler and catch it in main( ).
